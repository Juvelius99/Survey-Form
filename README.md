# Survey Form Project

## Purpose
This project was built to practice and solidify my knowledge of HTML forms, accessibility, and clean code.  
It is part of my ongoing self-education in preparation for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure with proper use of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Labels correctly associated with input elements for improved accessibility
- Radio buttons and select menu with clearly defined values for structured data submission
- Textarea included for open user feedback
- Basic form validation implemented using `required`, `min`, and `max` attributes
- Submit and Reset buttons for user-friendly interaction
- Clean and readable code with future extension in mind (planned CSS styling)

## Learning Outcome
Through building this Survey Form, I practiced:
- Structuring forms to ensure accessibility and usability
- Using various input types effectively, including text, number, email, radio buttons, select menus, and textarea
- Applying HTML best practices for clean and maintainable code
- Managing project versioning and workflow with Git and GitHub

## Potential Future Improvements
- Add CSS styling to enhance the visual presentation of the form
- Implement more advanced validation techniques with JavaScript
- Explore responsive design to improve usability on different devices
- Implement Aria accesibility Standards
